\usage{
FixZeros(data, group, remove.sparse.features = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe of gene/abundance counts.}

\item{group}{a factor specifying samples' group which should be represented by
a column from a metadata file.}

\item{remove.sparse.features}{a logical argument (TRUE/FALSE) for removal of
features with sum of zero counts larger than the size of the smallest
sample group, and for replacing the remaining zeros.  Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
a data frame with fixed zeros. Features having sum of zero counts
        higher than the size of the smallest sample group are removed and
        remaining zeros will be replaced by default.
}
\description{
This function detects zero/negative values and replaces zero
values in the data. In the first step, the function checks for the presence
of zero and negative values in the data. In the second step, (activated by
default), features having sum of zero counts higher than the size of the
smallest sample group will be removed (e.g. genes represented by zero
counts/transcripts in more than n samples will be removed; n = size of the
smallest group). Next, remaining zeros are substituted with minimal values
(>0) observed in each feature across all samples.
