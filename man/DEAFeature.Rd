\title{DEA_feature - calculation of differential expression/abundance
based on one comparison}
\usage{
DEAFeature(
  contrast.matrix,
  data,
  design.matrix,
  cutoff.logFC = 1,
  cutoff.FDR = 0.01,
  block = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{contrast.matrix}{an array containing contrast.matrix between groups of
interest.}

\item{data}{a matrix of (transformed and normalized) feature counts from
"seq", "array", "ms" or "other" technology (with feature IDs as row names
and sample IDs as columns).}

\item{design.matrix}{a design matrix based on samples metadata (groups,
covariates, etc.).}

\item{cutoff.logFC}{A cutoff value for the logarithmic fold change applied
to each feature. Default = 1.}

\item{cutoff.FDR}{a cutoff value for the false discovery rate (corrected
p-value) applied to each feature. Default = 0.01.}

\item{block}{a factor specifying blocking variable. The block must be of
the same length as data and contain 2 or more options (e.g. could be
represented by a column from a metadata file). Default = NULL.}
}
\value{
a list of up and donw-regulated features in limma format
}
\description{
a function for applying differential expression/abundance
analysis using limma. The analysis is usually based on normalized feature
counts (e.g., genes), design matrix and contrast matrix (using only 1
contrast). Cutoffs for logFC and FDR; and blocking variable are optional.
