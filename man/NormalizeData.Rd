\usage{
NormalizeData(data, group, transform, standardize, technology)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame of expression/abundance counts}

\item{group}{a factor specifying group for each sample (e.g. could be
represented by a column from a metadata file).}

\item{transform}{a string vector of length 1 defining transformation type for
each dataset ("log2", "logit", "log10"). If technology is "seq", this option
is ignored an Voom transform is applied..}

\item{standardize}{a string vector of length 1 defining standardization
method ("mean" or "median"). If technology is "seq" or "array", this option
is ignored, instead, seq data are normalized by "TMM"; array data are
normalized by "quantile" standardization.}

\item{technology}{a string vector of length 1 defining technology used for
generating the data. Allowed types are: 'array', 'seq', 'ms' or 'other'.}
}
\value{
Elist (seq technology) or array (array, ms, other technologies) of
normalized and transformed feature counts data
}
\description{
This function normalizes and transforms feature counts depending
on data types and selected normalization/standardization methods.
Transformation methods include options log2, logit and log10. If technology
is "seq", a Voom transform is applied automatically. Standardization methods
options include "mean" or "median". If technology is "seq" or "array", this
option is ignored, instead, sequencing data are normalized by "TMM";
micro-arrays data are normalized by "quantile" standardization.

\examples{
\dontrun{
###In this example, data with fixed zeros are used as an input.
NormalizeData(data=campp2_brca_1_zeroFix,
group=campp2_brca_1_meta$diagnosis, standardize="TMM", transform="voom",
technology="seq")
}
