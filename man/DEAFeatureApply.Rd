\title{Apply DEA to all group comparisons}
\usage{
DEAFeatureApply(
  data,
  design.matrix,
  contrast.matrix,
  cutoff.logFC,
  cutoff.FDR,
  block,
  vector = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a raw feature count matrix from "seq", "array", "ms" or "other"
technology (with feature IDs as row names and sample IDs as columns). It's
recommended to import feature counts using function "import_counts".}

\item{design.matrix}{a design matrix based on samples metadata (groups, covariates,
etc.).}

\item{contrast.matrix}{an array containing contrast.matrix between groups of
interest.}

\item{cutoff.logFC}{A cutoff value for the logarithmic fold change applied
to each feature. Default = 1.}

\item{cutoff.FDR}{a cutoff value for the false discovery rate (corrected
p-value) applied to each feature. Default = 0.01.}

\item{block}{a factor specifying blocking variable. The block must be of
the same length as data and contain 2 or more options (e.g. could be
represented by a column from a metadata file). Default = NULL.}

\item{vector}{a boolean value. If TRUE, only a vector of unique features IDs
will be output. Default = FALSE.}
}
\value{
a list (a vector in case vector=TRUE) of DEA features for all
comparisons
}
\description{
a function for applying differential expression/abundance
analysis to all group comparisons at once. The analysis is based on feature
counts (e.g., genes), design matrix and contrast matrix. Cutoffs for logFC
and FDR; and blocking variable are optional. Using parameter vector=TRUE, only
features' IDs are output.

###SHOULD I create an input data (part of the package) for this function? Meaning design and contrast matrix?
