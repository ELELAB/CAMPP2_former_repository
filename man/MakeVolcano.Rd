\title{Make Volcano Plot of DEA features}
\usage{
MakeVolcano(
  data,
  prefix,
  cutoff.logFC = 1,
  cutoff.FDR = 0.01,
  n.labeled.features = 15
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame from RunDEA containing genes and their
corresponding AveExpr, logFC, p.value, adj.p.value ect. Mandatory columns
are "logFC", "adj.P.Val" and "HUGO_ID." HUGO_ID could be obtained using
AddGeneName function.}

\item{prefix}{a prefix for the output filename.}

\item{cutoff.logFC}{a numeric value for logFC cutoff. Default = 1}

\item{cutoff.FDR}{a numeric value for adj.P.Val cutoff. Default = 0.01}

\item{n.labeled.features}{a number of the most up-/down- regulated features
labeled in the volcano plot. Default = 15}
}
\value{
Volcano plot of differentially expressed features saved into .png
}
\description{
A function for making volcano plots from DEA results.
The input is typically an output from RunDEA (re-formatted matrix of
differential expression/abundance results from limma, please, check RunDEA
for more details). By default, top 15 up- and down-regulated features
will be labeled on the Volcano plot. Important: Features are selected from
the table with all the groups' comparisons.
}
\examples{
{
##The input is made by example script from AddGeneName function
MakeVolcano(campp2_brca_1_DEA_HUGO, prefix = "test_volcano",
cutoff.logFC = 1, cutoff.FDR = 0.01, n.labeled.features = 15)
}
}
