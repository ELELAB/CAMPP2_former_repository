#' @title Make Volcano Plot of DEA features
#' @description A function for making volcano plots from DEA results.
#' The input is typically an output from RunDEA (re-formatted matrix of
#' differential expression/abundance results from limma, please, check RunDEA
#' for more details). By default, top 15 up- and down-regulated features
#' will be labeled on the Volcano plot. Important: Features are selected from
#' the table with all the groups' comparisons.
#' @param data A data frame from RunDEA containing genes and their
#' corresponding AveExpr, logFC, p.value, adj.p.value ect. Mandatory columns
#' are "logFC", "adj.P.Val" and "HUGO_ID." HUGO_ID could be obtained using
#' AddGeneName function.
#' @param prefix a prefix for the output filename.
#' @param cutoff.FDR a numeric value for adj.P.Val cutoff. Default = 0.01
#' @param cutoff.logFC a numeric value for logFC cutoff. Default = 1
#' @param n.labeled.features a number of the most up-/down- regulated features
#' labeled in the volcano plot. Default = 15
#' @export
#' @import ggplot2
#' @import ggrepel
#' @return Volcano plot of differentially expressed features saved into .png
#' @examples {
#' ##The input is made by example script from AddGeneName function
#' MakeVolcano(campp2_brca_1_DEA_HUGO, prefix = "test_volcano",
#' cutoff.logFC = 1, cutoff.FDR = 0.01, n.labeled.features = 15)
