#' @title A wrapper function for random forest classification and variable selection
#' @description The function runs random forest classification and variable
#' selection by running the RFApply function. The classification and variable
#' selection are calculated 10 times for 10 random seeds and the intersection of
#' the selected variables (e.g., genes) is obtained.
#' The function optionally performs validation using a validation
#' dataset of the random forest classification if there is enough samples in the
#' dataset. This is determined by the split.size argument. If validation is not
#' performed, only variable selection using random forest is carried out.
#' The function also intersects the selected features across all 10 seed runs
#' as found during the feature selection process.
#' @param data a matrix of (transformed and normalized) feature counts from
#' "seq", "array", "ms" or "other" technology (with feature IDs as row names
#' and sample IDs as columns). If available, batch corrected data should be used.
#' @param group a factor specifying group for each sample (e.g. could be
#' represented by a column from a metadata file)
#' @param split.size an integer specifying the minimum number of samples that
#' the groups must contain in order to carry out random forest classification
#' and validation
#' @param test.train.ratio a floating point number between 0 and 1 representing
#' the ratio of samples to keep as validation dataset. For example, a
#' test.train.ratio = 0.25 splits 25 percent of the data into a validation dataset,
#' meaning 75 percent of the data will be kept as the training dataset.
#' @param num.trees.init an integer specifying number of trees to use for the first
#' forest in the feature selection process. Default is 5000.
#' @param num.trees.iterat an integer specifying number of trees to use for
#' all additional forests in the feature selection process. Default is 2000.
