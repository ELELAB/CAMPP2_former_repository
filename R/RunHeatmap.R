#' @title RunHeatmap
#' @description A function for making heatmaps to showcase the difference in
#' expression/abundance of features across samples and sample groups and to
#' visualise relations between them.
#' @param feature.counts a feature count matrix (ideally normalized and batch
#' corrected) generated by "seq", "array", "ms" or "other" technology (with
#' feature IDs as row names and sample IDs as columns). It's recommended to
#' import feature counts using function "import_counts".
#' @param DEA.out.heatmap a sorted data frame representing output from one of:
#' 1) runDEA which is based on the output format from limma.
#' Data frame sorted e.g. by logFC. Mandatory column is "name".
#' 2) runLASSO (including feature names)
#' 3) consensus of DEA and LASSO/EN/Ridge regression generated by
#' RunDEA_LASSO_consensus and and including features sorted based on DEA
#' logFC values). Mandatory column is "name".
#' @param heatmap.size an argument specifying how many genes will be selected
#' to be plotted on the heatmap if plot.heatmap is TRUE. The input must be
#' specified as an even number. Default is 30.
#'
#' Please, consider that some of the TOP DEA features might be present multiple
#' times in the DEA output due to the multiple groups comparisons.
#' On the heatmap, each feature will be projected only once so the final number
#' of the projected features migh by lower then heatmap.size.
#' @param group a factor specifying group for each sample (e.g. could be
#' represented by a column from a metadata file). Group's information
#' will be used in clustering the samples.
#' @param viridis.palette a character vector specifying color gradient to use for
#' the heatmap. Default option for viridis color palettes is 'turbo'. For more
#' options, see viridis vignette.
#' @param plot.heatmap an argument defining which data will be used for
#' the selection of the top x features to be plotted on the heatmap.
#' Options are:"DEA", "LASSO", "EN", "Ridge" or "Consensus".
#' @param prefix a character vector defining prefix of output file name.
#' @param data.type a character vector for labeling units in the legend.
#' Default is "expression/abundance".
