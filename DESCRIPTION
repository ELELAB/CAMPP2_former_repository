Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nikola Tom
Maintainer: Nikola Tom <1nikola.tom@gmail.com>
Description: The CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline2 (CAMPP2) is a simple
  bioinformatics tool intended to automatize identification of potential
  diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers. The pipeline is versatile
  and may be used for analysis of a variety of quantitative biological
  data from high throughput platforms, including genes, proteins, small
  RNAs, lipids and glycans. CAMPP2 currently supports; differential expression/
  abundance analysis, LASSO/Elastic Net regression,Weighed
  Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, Correlation analysis and Survival
  analysis (Cox proportional hazard regression).
